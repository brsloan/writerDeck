# DIY WriterDecks

I'm compiling a list of all the DIY writerDecks I can find in order to inspire others (me) looking to build one. And also because I just like looking at them and knowing they exist. Feel free to suggest any I've missed!

# Setups For Using Phones/Tablets As WriterDecks

For tablet decks, phone decks, and other almost-WriterDecks, please see this list [here](/list-of-tablet-writerdecks.md).
